The given application was created for the purpose of managing car ownership in a decentralised manner. 

Centralised car management has a large number of issues associated with it.
The transactions involving them are not transparent, theft and fraud are a commonplace, and the historical information available about cars is often limited.
The given project involves centralising the management of car ownership in order to solve all of these issues.
The dApp produced as a result of this project consists of two layers - the frontend, and the smart contract.
The features on Polkadot available in the given version are as follows:
  - Creating a new Car instance with owner and information
  - Retrieving information about owner and car
  - Transferring ownership of cars

The frontend of this application uses React framework of JavaScript.
The smart contract uses Solidity as its programming language, with hardhat as its development environment.
